Welcome to Transport Analysis's documentation!
=========================================================

Transport Analysis provides an efficient, flexible, and customizable
set of tools for computing and analyzing transport properties.
It harnesses the power of `MDAnalysis <https://www.mdanalysis.org/>`_'s
core `AtomGroup` and `Universe` data structures to quickly access
trajectory data and execute complex transport property calculations.
Unless otherwise stated, all calculations and results are in `MDAnalysis
standard units <https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/units>`_.

To begin, check out the Getting Started section of the documentation.
